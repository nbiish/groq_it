# Groq Query Runner

This repository contains scripts for querying the Groq API.  
It's designed to be used with Mac or Windows shortcuts for quick use.


## Overview

The main components:

- `groq_query.py`: sends a text query to the Groq API and outputs the response
- `groq_query.sh`: is used to run the Python script
- `groq_mac.sh`: shortcuts and automations arent running the scipts right

## Usage

1. Automatically creates a virtual environment and installs the necessary Python dependencies.
2. Add your Groq api key in the `.env` file.
3. Use Mac shortcuts to run the `groq_query.sh` script. This will run the `groq_query.py` script.


Please refer to the individual scripts for more detailed usage instructions.
