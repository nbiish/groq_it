# Groq Query Runner

This repository contains scripts for querying the Groq API. It is designed to be used with Mac shortcuts for ease of use.


## Overview

The main components:

- `groq_query.py`: sends a text query to the Groq API and outputs the response
- `groq_query.sh`: is used to run the Python script

## Usage

2. Add your Groq api key in the `.env` file.
3. Use Mac shortcuts to run the `groq_query.sh` script. This will run the `groq_query.py` script.
